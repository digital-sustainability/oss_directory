 * Bootstrap

 * An asynchronous bootstrap function that runs just before your Sails app gets lifted.

  // ```
  // // Set up fake development data (or if we already have some, avast)
  // if (await User.count() > 0) {
  //   return done();
  // }
  //
  // await User.createEach([
  //   { emailAddress: 'ry@example.com', fullName: 'Ryan Dahl', },
